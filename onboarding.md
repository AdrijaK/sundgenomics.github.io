## Onboarding with the Genomics Platform

Welcome to your new institute!!

Here is the onboarding process:

- Read the overall documentation to get a first idea about the general support and the direct sequencing services [here](/project/).
- Make sure you have an [account on PPMS](http://ppms.eu/ku/?Genomics) or create one.
- Join your institute slack organisation (reNEW or CPR) by asking a colleague to add you or send you an invitation link. Then join the Genomics Platform channel (shared between reNEW and CPR organizations).
- Contact us via [genomics@sund.ku.dk](mailto:genomics@sund.ku.dk) mentioning your KU ID (also called by some of us the "swedish plate") and asking for an onboarding meeting. We will then schedule a 30 min meeting to briefly go through all the steps together.
